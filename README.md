You can read more about it here -> https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification

## To run the project: 
Just open the link to the colab notebook and you should be good to go. :)

## Architecture: 
Currently trying to improve the accuracy of the model, will update the final architecture here, once done.

## Code Flow: 
Will be updated once the project is finished. 

## Results: 
Current model will the following stats         
    precision    recall  f1-score   support
